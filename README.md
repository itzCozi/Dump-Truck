# Dump-Truck
Dump-Truck is a user friendly and beginner friendly dumper/process manager, Using this program is similar to using UPM you have to pass arguments through the command prompt all the commands are listed [here](https://github.com/itzCozi/Dump-Truck/wiki/Commands&Arguments) or in the `help` argument.

## Processes
Dump-Truck has multiple commands that relate to or manage processes the get-running command for example is a very slow command depending how many processes are currently opened. If a command is running slowly or prints `Please wait this may take a moment...` then its fetching the running processes I try to optimize as much as I can though processes are slow and hard to fetch constantly.

## Errors/Logging
Whenever the program encounters an error it will do one of two things, if its expected the error will be accounted for by name if this is not the case its a broad exception that prints the error below the program's exception message.

## Arguments Over Versions
All arguments will always be listed in the wiki and `help` command though over compiled and python versions calling to the script changes all parameters are kept constant between compiled and source versions using a dynamic system that changes depending on the programs file extension.
